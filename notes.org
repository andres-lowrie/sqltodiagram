#+TITLE: notes

* If we're going to create all the tables first then we need to parse inside out
  where all the tables from the subquery are processed first
* Return Types
** targetList
  List of `ResTarget`s
  The table that we want to generate
** ResTarget
   name = alias of column in result if given
   val = `ColumnRef`
** ColumnRef
  holds the `field`s that will be returned.
  It can be keyed as type or have a special keys like "A_Star"
** RangeSubselect
   holds embedded select structure in `subquery`
   and the alias that postgres requires in `alias`
** RangeVar
   Refers to the table
* graphviz
** "tables" need to be nodes
** "columns" need to be "fields"
** "edges" need to be relationships
* Things to handle
** "resTargets" can have multiple fields in the columnRef dict
   Whatever function ends up handling creating the table nodes should be able to
   take both fqn (Fully Qualified Names) or just column names.
